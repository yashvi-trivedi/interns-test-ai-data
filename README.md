This repository contains a Python-based Question-to-Concept mapping tool. It is to be used for mapping competitve exam questions (eg: UPSC) to their high-level academic concepts using two methods:
* Keyword-based dictionary mapping (default)
* LLM based mapping (optional with API key)

## Implementation details
1. **Concept Dictionaries**
   The pre-built dictionary consists of:
   * Concept names (eg: Buddhism, Profit and Loss)
   * Associated keywords indicating the concept
2. **Two modes:**
   * Keyword-based matching:
     No external dependency. The script searches for concepts related to keywords in the question.
   * LLM-based matching:
     If an Anthropic API key is provided in .env, this method will be used. `call_anthropic` extracts concepts semantically.

## Example Run

**Run the script:**
```
python concept_mapper.py --subject ancient_history
```
**Output:**
```
Q6: ['indus valley civilization']
```
**In csv:**
```
Question Number,Question,Concepts
6,Which one of the following is not a Harappan site?,indus valley civilization
```
